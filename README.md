# N1C – A Decentralized Open Currency

**N1C** is a decentralized, open, and human-centred currency built for everyday people.  
It is designed as a **lightweight alternative to blockchain systems**, offering free peer-to-peer transactions and simple fiat ↔ digital exchange through trusted anchors.  

The goal of N1C is to **empower communities worldwide** — especially in regions underserved by traditional banking — with an easy-to-use, trustworthy, and sustainable financial tool.

## 🌍 Why N1C?

Billions of people still face barriers to basic financial services.  
Existing blockchain-based currencies promise openness but are often:  

- **Too complex** (blockchains require heavy computation and high maintenance).  
- **Too expensive** (transaction fees or gas charges hurt small payments).  
- **Too volatile** (users cannot rely on them for daily life).  
- **Too exclusionary** (hard to integrate with real-world money and merchants).  

**N1C takes a different path**:  
- Simple, lightweight ledger instead of a blockchain.  
- No mining, no proof-of-work, no wasted energy.  
- Free peer-to-peer transfers.  
- Anchors manage exchange with local money in a transparent, fair way.

## ⚙️ How N1C Works

### 1. The Ledger
- N1C uses a **public ledger** to record all transactions.  
- Unlike blockchain, there are **no blocks** — each transaction is stored individually.  
- Anyone can host a copy of the ledger, making the system **resilient** and **transparent**.  
- User identities are hidden — the ledger records only transactions, not names.  

### 2. Anchors
- Anchors are trusted participants who connect **real-world currencies** to N1C.  
- They provide **on/off ramps** for exchanging money:  
  - Local currency → N1C  
  - N1C → Local currency (or other currencies)  
- Anchors set a **spread** (2–7%) and charge a **small fixed tax** (0.02) that supports the N1C Foundation.  
- Anchors validate their own transactions and publish them to the ledger.  

### 3. Peer-to-Peer Transfers
- **N1C ↔ N1C** transactions are **free**.  
- Transfers are instant, validated automatically, and cost nothing to the end user.  
- This ensures that everyday payments — like sending money to a friend or paying a shop — are simple and affordable.  

### 4. Exchange and Rates
- Exchange between currencies is managed by **anchors**.  
- Anchors publish their exchange rates transparently.  
- Users choose which anchor to exchange through (similar to selecting a money changer).  
- Competition keeps rates fair, while the 0.02 foundation tax ensures long-term sustainability.

## 🔐 Privacy and Security

- **Pseudonymous ledger:** transactions are visible, but personal names are hidden.  
- **Anchors are accountable:** since they handle fiat ↔ N1C, they must maintain transparent practices.  
- **Users control their wallets:** no central authority can freeze balances or censor transfers.

## 🏛 Governance

The project is stewarded by the **N1C Foundation**, a non-profit organisation (to be established).  

The Foundation will:  
- Maintain the N1C protocol and standards.  
- Support anchors, developers, and merchants.  
- Fund community-driven improvements.  
- Ensure that N1C always remains **free software** and **open to all**.  

Anchors provide financial gateways, but **power remains distributed** across the network.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds:  

- **Development:** building the ledger, wallet, and anchor APIs.  
- **Documentation:** explaining N1C to users, anchors, and merchants.  
- **Testing:** running early prototypes and stress-testing the system.  
- **Community:** spreading awareness and helping onboard anchors.  

For now, development is at the **conceptual and documentation stage**.  
When prototypes are available, we will publish clear guidelines on how to run nodes and contribute.
