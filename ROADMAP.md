# N1C Roadmap

This roadmap describes the development phases of N1C, the decentralized open currency project.  
The goal is to provide transparency, set realistic milestones, and allow contributors to understand where they can help.

- [ ] Recruit early supporters (volunteers, testers, anchors).

---

## Phase 1: Prototype Ledger & Wallet (2026 Q1–Q2)
- [ ] Develop minimal ledger software to record transactions (transaction-based, not block-based).
- [ ] Create a command-line wallet for sending/receiving N1C.
- [ ] Test simple peer-to-peer transfers with zero transaction fee.
- [ ] Document ledger protocol for review.

---

## Phase 2: Anchors & Currency Exchange (2026 Q3)
- [ ] Implement anchor role (trusted entities for fiat/N1C exchange).
- [ ] Define anchor spreads (2%–7%) and small network tax (0.02).
- [ ] Support conversion between N1C and real-world currencies.
- [ ] Add anchor management tools for reporting and transparency.

---

## Phase 3: Developer & Merchant Tools (2026 Q4)
- [ ] Create APIs for integrating N1C into websites and apps.
- [ ] Build payment gateway plugins (for e-commerce and services).

---

## Phase 4: Foundation & Governance (2027 Q1)
- [ ] Establish N1C Foundation as independent steward.
- [ ] Publish governance model and anchor guidelines.
- [ ] Expand contributor base with global community.

---

## Phase 5: Scaling & Sustainability (2027+)
- [ ] Optimise ledger for speed and resilience.
- [ ] Introduce lightweight mobile wallet.
- [ ] Expand to more currencies and anchors worldwide.
- [ ] Build sustainable funding for the foundation through:
  - small anchor tax,
  - grants,
  - donations.

### Long-Term Vision
N1C will become:
- A **simple, resilient, and human-centred currency**.
- Usable in daily life for payments and savings.
- A global open standard, free from blockchain complexity.
