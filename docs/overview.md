# N1C Overview

## What is N1C?
N1C (Network 1 Currency) is an **open, decentralized currency** designed to be easy, lightweight, and human-centred.  
Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, N1C does **not rely on blockchain mining** or complex consensus. Instead, it uses a **shared public ledger** that anyone can run, read, and verify.

## Why N1C?
Many people around the world cannot access modern financial systems or pay high fees to move money.  
N1C aims to:
- Enable fast and free peer-to-peer transfers.
- Provide fair exchange between real-world money and N1C.
- Be easy to use in daily payments, even in low-resource settings.
- Stay **open source** and belong to the community.

---

## How it Works
- **Ledger:** A distributed log of transactions. Each transfer is recorded, but user identities are hidden.
- **Wallet:** Users hold balances in N1C and can send or receive instantly with zero transaction fee.
- **Anchors:** Trusted participants who exchange N1C with local currencies. They earn a small spread (2%–7%) plus a tiny network tax (0.02).
- **Foundation:** A neutral steward to maintain the protocol, protect openness, and support community growth.
